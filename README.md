## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (with `backdrop-filter`, gradients, keyframes)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

---

## 🎯 How It Works

- When the user hovers over the card, JavaScript calculates the cursor's position relative to the center of the card.
- It then applies a `rotateX` and `rotateY` transformation based on that position.
- The background uses a conic gradient glow animated with a `@keyframes` rotation.
- The glass effect is achieved with `rgba()` transparency and `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`.
